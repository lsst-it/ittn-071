\section{Introduction}


In the following document we will explain step by step the current procedure to upgrade the version of Kubernetes through rke (Rancher Kubernetes Engine), which is the current tool we use to assemble our Kubernetes Clusters.

It is very important to try to keep up with the current version of this software as it can:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Apply security patches to the software.
\item
  Apply bug fixes to solve issues from the past versions
\item
  Improve performance in some cases.
\item
  Add new features that could improve utilization of the product.
\end{itemize}
